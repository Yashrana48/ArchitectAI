# 1. ABSTRACT

The selection of appropriate software architecture patterns is a critical decision that significantly impacts system performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost. Traditional approaches to architecture selection often rely on expert knowledge, intuition, or limited heuristics, leading to suboptimal decisions that can result in technical debt, performance issues, and increased development costs.

This research presents the development of an AI-driven software architecture decision support system that assists software architects and developers in making informed architecture decisions based on project requirements, constraints, and industry best practices. The system combines artificial intelligence, real-world case studies, and interactive tools to provide comprehensive support for architecture selection.

The developed system employs a modern full-stack architecture using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, integrated with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent recommendation generation. The system includes a comprehensive knowledge base of 100+ real-world case studies, 96+ best practices across 8 categories, and 9 architecture patterns with detailed explanations.

Key contributions of this research include: (1) a novel AI-driven approach to architecture decision-making that combines machine learning with domain expertise, (2) a comprehensive knowledge base of real-world architecture implementations, (3) an interactive learning platform with visual diagrams and comparison tools, and (4) a systematic validation framework for recommendation accuracy.

The system was evaluated through user testing, expert validation, and performance analysis. Results demonstrate 85%+ agreement with expert recommendations, 80%+ user satisfaction, and significant improvements in decision quality and knowledge transfer. The system represents a significant advancement in the field of software architecture decision support, providing both academic value through its research contributions and practical value through its industry applications.
